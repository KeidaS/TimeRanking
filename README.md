# TimeRanking
Time Ranking for CS:GO servers.

The Rank gets the total time the player has been in the server, the time playing as Terrorist and the time playing as CT.

For using this plugin you need to add this to your databses.cfg file (the file is located in \csgo\addons\sourcemod\configs\databases.cfg):


"rankme"
	{
		"driver"			"mysql"
		"host"				"YOUR HOST"
		"database"			"rank" (you can put what you want)
		"user"				"YOUR USER"
		"pass"				"YOUR PASSWORD"
	}
